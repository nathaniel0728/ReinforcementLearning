# ReinforcementLearning
Code for Reinforcement Learning

Code offers integration of TensorFlow into RL-based environments. 
It is recommended that you set up a virtual environment for necessary packages as outlined in requirements.txt

Clone into current repository:
`git clone http://www.github.com/nathaniel0728/rl`

Install virtualenv (if not yet available):
`pip install virtualenv`

Create virtual environment with python2.7 (command on linux):
`virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv`

Activate venv:
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note: If tensorflow does not install, refer to tensorflow's official website for further instructions.

Use python2.7 to run programs. 

To deactivate virtualenv, run command:
`deactivate`

Note: Maze does not use OpenAI due to complications as of now.
