# ReinforcementLearning
Code for Reinforcement Learning

Code offers integration of TensorFlow into RL-based environments. 
It is recommended that you set up a virtual environment for necessary packages as outlined in requirements.txt

Clone into current repository:
`git clone http://www.github.com/nathaniel0728/rl`

Install virtualenv (if not yet available):
`pip install virtualenv`

Create virtual environment:
`virtualenv venv`

Activate venv:
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Use python2 to run programs. 

To deactivate virtualenv, run command:
`deactivate`

Note: Maze does not use OpenAI due to complications
